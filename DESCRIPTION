Description: Bootstrapped correlation and response functions are widely used in dendrochronology to calibrate tree-ring proxy data against multiple instrumental time series of climatic variables. With this package, we provide functionality similar to DENDROCLIM2002 (Biondi and Waikul (2004) <10.1016/j.cageo.2003.11.004>). A full description with examples is given in Zang and Biondi (2013) <10.1016/j.dendro.2012.08.001>.
