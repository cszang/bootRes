* Changes in version 1.2.2

** CHANGED the return value of mdcc to a list of data.frames containing the coefficients and the confidence intervals; previously, only the coefficients were returned as a single data.frame. mdcplot and the documentations have been adjusted.
	 
* Changes in version 1.2.1

** FIXED a parameter can not be judged significant, if the CI contains 0 (thanks to Christof Bigler for reporting the bug).

* Changes in version 1.2

** bootRes now checks for the number of predictor variables and issues an error if it higher than the size of the moving window (mdc) or the overlapping time span of chronos and climate data (dcc)
** revised example data: chronos now with fixed length spline detrending
** bugfixes in the docs
* Changes in version 1.1

** added NAMESPACE
** added more options for confidence intervals (set with ci = ... in functions dcc() and mdcc())

* Changes in version 1.0

** added moving response and correlation functions
** added plotting support for moving response and correlation functions
** reworked dcplot function for vertical and horizontal plotting layouts
   
* Changes in version 0.3

** workhorse function renamed to dcc(), kept an alias from dendroclim() for compatibility
** support for climate data formatted according to DENDROCLIM2002 specs
** added more example data

* Changes in version 0.2

** climatic data are not any longer restricted to the combination temperature and precipitation; an arbitrary number of variables can be handled
** added option in dendroclim to suppress status bar (defaults to TRUE, useful for e.g. Sweave-documents)
